# Html-TADS
Unlike [tads-runner](https://github.com/captain-mayhem/tads-runner), which is licensed under GPL-2.0, this repository comes with a very restrictive license.

From the license file of html-tads:
"This source code is distributed for the specific purpose of
facilitating the creation of versions of TADS on various computers and
operating systems. All other derivative works are prohibited without
the written permission of the author.
...
If you port TADS to a new platform, the author does grant permission
for you to distribute your ported version - I encourage it, in fact."

Since my goal is only to recompile htmltads as a 64-bit executable running on a Windows 11 PC 
with a modern compiler and a CMake buildsystem without changing the feature set of htmltads,
this project is supposed to fall under the porting TADS exception.
